# Developer_Portfolio

### This portfolio is used to display some of my current work, some information about me and some ways to contact me.
### Future development - I want to create a hidden login to be able to log into my portfolio and edit projects and about me, contect info from the app. This will also incorporate models, mysql and sequlize.
